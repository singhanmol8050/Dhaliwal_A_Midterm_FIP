  <h2>HOW COWBELL GIVES BACK
</h2>

  <p>
At Modglide, we always strive to do the right thing.

The Sparling family has donated $1 million to the Canadian <br> Centre for Rural Creativity in honour of Grant and Mildred Sparling, who moved to Blyth independently, <br> and met in the community they would call home. Grant was a successful<br>entrepreneur at heart and created several businesses in his lifetime, but he never forgot the support<br> of Blyth and area when opened his first hardware store on Queen Street in 1951. Grant and Mildred were actively<br> involved in the village, were proud to call Blyth home, and spent their lives repaying the kindness to the community in mostly<br> inconspicuous ways, some of which were only known after their passing.<br><br>

Our Greener Pastures Community Fund is just one of the exciting ways we are sharing this <br>journey with you. In December 2016, Modglide launched a long-term relationship supporting <br>Ontario’s four children’s hospitals. Modglide donates five cents from every can and pint sold, from the very first beer ever sold in <br>May 2016, to be investedin specific projects at each of the children’s hospitals every year. Modglide also supports the<br> foundations through event participation and by raising awareness of the important and life-changing work of the remarkable <br>people in these world-class hospitals. Proceeds from the Greener Pastures Community Fund will support life-enhancing programs to improve <br>children’s health and well-being during their time in hospital. Funds raised will also support the Grant and Mildred Sparling Centre at The Canadian Centre for Rural Creativity.<br><br>
